I designed the YouTube home page user interface(dark mode) using React and Redux.

To get the video data I fetched from the Google YouTube API where my URL specifically targets the 12 most popular videos in the United States.

Featured languages: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
Featured libraries: React.js, Redux.js
